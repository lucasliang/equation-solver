Java programs dealing with various kinds of linear equation/matrix solving programs.

#Determinant Finder:
Uses a row-reduction to upper-triangle matrix algorithm.

Sample Run:
Enter your matrix:
2 1 -3
4 0 1
3 2 1
Determinant: -29.0

Linear Equation Solver:
Uses matrix reduction to solve the linear system. Currently can only use up to 20 variables, although that is easy to change. Can handle free variables, redundant equations, and unsolvable systems. 

TODO:
User IO could be a bit more robust, but the way I have it set up works fine, just causes some (minor) inconveniences (namely, all variables are of the form "ax1","bx2", etc. and it can't handle subtraction, only negative coefficients).

#Sample Runs:
Please enter your equations in the form:
3x1 + -2x2 + 5x5 = 3
Current maximum number of variables: 20
Enter 'q' when finished
2x1 + -x2 + 5x3 + x4 = -3
3x1 + 2x2 + 2x3 + -6x4 = -32
x1 + 3x2 + 3x3 + -x4 = -47
5x1 + -2x2 + -3x3 + 3x4 = 49
q
Solutions:
x1 = 2
x2 = -12
x3 = -4
x4 = 1

Please enter your equations in the form:
3x1 + -2x2 + -x5 = 3
Current maximum number of variables: 20
Enter 'q' when finished
x1 + x2 = 0
x1 + x2 = 1
q
No solutions

Please enter your equations in the form:
3x1 + -2x2 + -x5 = 3
Current maximum number of variables: 20
Enter 'q' when finished
x1 + 2x2 + 4x3 = 0
-3x1 + 2x2 + -4x3 = 0
5x1 + 4x2 + 14x3 = 0
q
Solutions:
x1 = -2x3 + 0
x2 = -1x3 + 0

#Balancing Chemical Equations:
Solution by converting the chemical reaction to a linear system of equations, then finding a scalar to multiply through by to make everything an integer.

TODO:
1) My program can't handle parentheses in the chemical equation, though this can be avoided by distributing the coefficients
2) I think if you specifically overload the input with molecules of many redundant elements (eg. H20 + O2 -> HO + H2 + O2 or something), it would cause an error, but from what I understand, these situations never happen in practice when doing real problems

Sample Runs:
Please enter your equation without coefficients in the form:
"C6H12O6 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O"
C7H10N + O2 -> CO2 + H2O + NO2
Solutions:
2*C7H10N + 21*O2 -> 14*CO2 + 10*H2O + 2*NO2

Please enter your equation without coefficients in the form:
"C6H12O6 + O2 -> CO2 + H2O"
HClO4 + P4O10 -> H3PO4 + Cl2O7
Solutions:
12*HClO4 + 1*P4O10 -> 4*H3PO4 + 6*Cl2O7
